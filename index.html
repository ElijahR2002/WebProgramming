        Web developement to me is the easiest way for a novice programmer to show off some of their learned skills. Knowing how to create websites is a simple but efficient way to no only impress, but to practice and learn programming abilities. My hope for my career after college is one in front end software developement where I can assist in the design process and creation of a person's or company's website. 
        <h4>Three things I want to learn in this class</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>How to upload a website to its own domain for anyone to be able to view.</li>
            <li>How to connect an html page to a backend SQL database.</li>
            <li>How to create realtime reactive webpages with multiple users.</li>
        </ul>
